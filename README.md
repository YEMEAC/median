# median
We want to know the median

Simple example, imagine the following data: [4, 1, 6, 3, 7, 8, 7], to calculate the median
we need to sort it, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 8] and identify the median, in this case the Integer 6.
(is the middle index, has 3 items on the left side and 3 on the right side). Just keep in mind that
the amount of data will be huge and memory is going to be a problem
